# Core Services

These are the sercices wich are the core, the essence, of the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) environment.

Altough Google does not endorse this services as their 'core' services, in fact all those services are the base you need to build your applications and/or infrastructure on GCP.

Note that other services will use the services described here. For instance, both Dataflow and Dataproc will use Compute Engine to launch instances. Even it is possible to log in via ssh or from console and look what's going on inside the machines that provide advanced services.
