# Introduction

This is a study guide for Google Cloud Platform Professional Architect certification.

Google Cloud is a *huge* platform. And the certification exam is hard. Not just because GCP is big; but because it touches a lot of technologies and concepts that are not part of Google Cloud per se; but you need to know because it is user in real life(tm).

## Motivation
I passed the GCP Architecture exam in beta form two years ago and this are my notes to recertify myself.

The Google Cloud has changed a lot (hello KNative!). There are more services now, and some of the services that were in beta when I took the exam for the first time are in GA and are covered in the exam now.
