# Compute Engine

Compute engine is the Google Cloud service that allows you to run your workloads inside a server.
This, along with Cloud Storage, is the most basic service that a cloud computing operator can provide, and it is also one of the most important.
You'll see later Google provides other services (like K8s, Dataproc, or Dataflow) on top of Compute Engine, that's why it is important to understand the Compute Engine service well.

## Compute Instances

When you want to run some software, you need some resources to run it: a CPU that can process instructions, some memory, disk, networking, etc.
In Google Cloud that resource combination is provided by Compute Instances.

Instances have some amount of RAM, CPU Cores, Disks (which are Block Storage, not Object Storage).
Some instances may have specialized hardware like GPUs, and one or several network interfaces.

### Hardware Configuration and billing

In Google Cloud you are billed for the resources you use. Other cloud providers charge you for defining a virtual machine no matter if it is running or not.

GCP takes into account the resources you use and bills you by the second for:

- CPU
- RAM (GiB)
- Public IP addreses 
- GPUs

Other resources like bandwith are metered and billed by the amount you use.

#### Discounts

Google will try to pack your workloads into equivalent machines to offer you discounts.

The discounts you can get are for:

- Long-running loads.
- Equivalent machines
- Reserved Instances

Ephemeral instances, and Excended RAM (that's RAM Above 6.5GB per core) does not have discounts.
E2 Instances have a lower price than n1, n3 instances and does not have discounts either.
There is no dicount for using GPUs (which are a scarce resource).

### Free tier

As usual, there is a free tier. This free usage tier is thought to be used to test, develop, and operate services without incurring costs.
You can run a micro-t1 machine (0.25 score, 1GB ram) for 720h / month on shared hardware.
This VM can be used as a "bastion host" to access internal instances you might have on yout GCP projects.
You can set up a SSH or RDP server for that purpose.
